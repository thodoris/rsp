Play Rock-Scissors-Paper using python and OpenCV

## Getting Started

This is the basic version of a more complex project. The original project allows the user to play the game while capturing his brainwaves.
Then it usues machine learning in order to detect the intented move of the user before it actually happens.
This repository hosts only the game-playing part of the project (for trainning the ML Model).

### Prerequisites

Python 3 
OpenCV

```
python rsp.py
```
